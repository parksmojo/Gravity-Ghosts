Development Plan:

simple enemy waves
- initial 3-5

drops
- Zombies drop ammo, ghosts health, something like that

health readout etc
- can use the floor space?
- or other creative way of showing information

finish waves
- probably like 10?

Main menu and polishing
- tutorial text
- wave separation
- add images
- flush out scene

Make a way to save game progress between play sessions

After mob waves game becomes a platformer
- player can now exit sides or above
- more guns/shooting types
- puzzles

Endgame??
